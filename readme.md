##README
This project was created as a homework given at Computer Networks class in BMSTU.
The task was to write a chat using sockets on UDS.
####Requests
Client should be able to:
* to connect and to disconnect from server
* get and send messages
* get nicknames of all clients connected

I use threads in order many clients to connect at the same time.

####Server:
Run:

```
$ python3 server.py
```

And just wait for clients

Run:

```
$ python3 client.py
```

Follow given instructions.
